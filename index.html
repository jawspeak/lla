               <h2>Why use QuickBooks for Landlording?</h2>
               <p>QuickBooks is the #1 bestselling accounting software for small businesses.</p>
               <ul class="">
                  <li>Use the Mac, Windows, or Online version.</li>
                  <li>Over <mark>2.5 million businesses</mark> trust it.</li>
                  <li>Accountants love it (and often charge you less for their fees if you use this software which they are very familiar with).</li>
                  <li>You don't need to buy anything else</li>

               <h2>Why not use QuickBooks?</h2>
               <p>There are <mark>specialized landlord apps</mark> out there you can pay for. </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Those apps are better for <mark>big landlords</mark>, or ones that want those features. </li>
                  <li>We started this guide for ourselves in the <mark>early 2000's</mark> before many of those options existed. You still can use QB's, and it works well for some people.</li>
